    <h1>Internal Server Error :(</h1>
    <p>This is a generic error message indicating that the server 
        encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from 
        fulfilling the request. It is often a result of server-side 
        issues such as a bug in the code or a temporary server overload.</p>
